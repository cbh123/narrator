Clone this repo, and setup and activate a virtualenv:

```bash

python3 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the dependencies:

Make a new voice in Eleven and get the voice id of that voice using their [get voices](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/voices) API, or by clicking the flask icon next to the voice in the VoiceLab tab.
